I believe in picking the right tools.
Tech I've worked with over the years :
- Python : Lots of scripting, tiny projects, web services, SOA experience writing in Flask, Sanic, Django.. 
- Go : Scripting, tools, packages and dabbled with deeper async level thinking. Perfect match of freedom + reduced confusing choices. 
- Bash : For fun stuff
- AWS : I self host my website, VPN, etc here.
